# BlackBerry Spark Communications Services
BlackBerry Spark Communications Services is an IP-based cloud communications
platform that lets you easily create powerful new experiences between your
users, machines, and IoT devices. Its enterprise-grade communication and data
sharing functionality can be integrated directly into your Android, iOS and web
apps. With end-to-end encryption, digitally signed messages, and guaranteed
data delivery, Spark Communications is a secure CPaaS (communications
platform as a service) solution that can enable you to build powerful
connections around the world, while keeping everything safe and secure in a
“private garden” communication system.
